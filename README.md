# Manual Testing Portfolio 🧪

Welcome to my Manual Testing Portfolio. This repository showcases my hands-on experience with a range of manual testing techniques, tools, and workflows used in real-world software quality assurance. Each project reflects my ability to design, execute, and document test cases while adapting to various testing environments and platforms.

## 🔍 Skills Demonstrated

- **Test Case Design** – Creating clear, structured test cases based on user stories or requirements
- **Bug Reporting** – Logging, tracking, and verifying defects using tools like Jira
- **Cross-Platform Testing** – Validating functionality and usability across browsers and devices
- **Exploratory Testing** – Conducting unscripted testing to identify hidden issues
- **Documentation** – Maintaining detailed records through test reports and traceability matrices
